# Virtual Audio Setup Guide

## Why You Need Virtual Audio

To capture system audio (meeting participants, videos, music) along with your microphone, you need a virtual audio device that creates an audio "loop" from your system output back to an input that the app can record.

**What Gets Captured:**
- 🎤 **Microphone Input**: Your voice speaking
- 🔊 **System Audio Output**: Everything you hear (Teams, Zoom, YouTube, etc.)

## 🍎 macOS Setup (Tested & Working)

### Step 1: Install BlackHole

**Download:** https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole

1. Download **BlackHole 2ch** (2-channel version is sufficient)
2. Install the package
3. Restart your computer (recommended)

### Step 2: Create Multi-Output Device

This step routes your audio to BOTH your headset (so you hear it) AND BlackHole (so the app captures it).

1. **Open Audio MIDI Setup:**
   - Press `Cmd + Space`
   - Type "Audio MIDI Setup"
   - Press Enter

2. **Create Multi-Output Device:**
   - Click the **`+`** button (bottom left)
   - Select **"Create Multi-Output Device"**

3. **Configure the Multi-Output Device:**
   - Check these boxes:
     - ✅ **Your Headset/Speakers** (e.g., "Jabra EVOLVE 20 MS", "AirPods", etc.)
     - ✅ **BlackHole 2ch**
   
4. **Enable Drift Correction:**
   - Click on **"BlackHole 2ch"** in the list
   - Check the **"Drift Correction"** box (prevents audio sync issues)

5. **Set as System Output:**
   - Right-click on **"Multi-Output Device"**
   - Select **"Use This Device For Sound Output"**
   
   **OR** use System Settings:
   - Go to **System Settings → Sound → Output**
   - Select **"Multi-Output Device"**

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py
   ```

2. **Verify devices detected:**
   - 🎤 Microphone: Your headset or built-in mic
   - 🔊 System Audio: BlackHole 2ch

3. **Test with audio:**
   - Play a YouTube video or music
   - Speak into your microphone
   - Both should be transcribed separately!

### Important Notes for macOS

**✅ Recommended Usage:**
- **Keep Multi-Output as default** when using the app for meetings
- Your audio plays through both your headset AND BlackHole simultaneously
- You hear everything normally, app captures everything

**⚠️ If You Experience Issues:**
- Make sure Multi-Output Device is your system output
- Check that both devices are checked in Multi-Output
- Verify BlackHole is installed by checking available devices
- Restart the app after changing audio settings

**🔄 Switching Back to Normal:**
- System Settings → Sound → Output
- Select your normal headset/speakers
- Multi-Output only needed when transcribing

## Troubleshooting

### No System Audio Captured?

1. **Check Multi-Output Device is set as default:**
   - System Settings → Sound → Output → Multi-Output Device

2. **Verify BlackHole is in Multi-Output:**
   - Open Audio MIDI Setup
   - Multi-Output Device should have BlackHole checked

3. **Test with system sound:**
   ```bash
   say "Testing audio routing"
   ```
   The app should transcribe this.

### No Microphone Audio?

1. **Check microphone permissions:**
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone
   - Ensure Terminal has permission

2. **Verify correct device detected:**
   - Look at app startup messages for device selection

### Audio Quality Issues?

1. **Enable Drift Correction** on BlackHole in Multi-Output Device
2. **Match sample rates** (48000 Hz recommended)
3. **Use headphones** to prevent echo/feedback

### App Doesn't See BlackHole?

1. Restart the app after installing BlackHole
2. Verify BlackHole is installed:
   ```bash
   system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep BlackHole
   ```
