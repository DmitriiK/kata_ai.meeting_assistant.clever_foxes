## Overview

This guide helps you set up virtual audio devices for two key features:

### 1. **System Audio Capture** (Transcription)
Capture audio from meeting applications (Zoom, Teams, Telegram, etc.) so the Meeting Assistant can transcribe what other participants say, not just your microphone input.

### 2. **TTS Translation Routing**
Route AI-generated speech translations to your meeting app's microphone input so your conversation partners hear the translation as if you spoke it.

---

## What You'll Achieve

After completing this setup:

✅ **Capture system audio** from meeting apps for transcription  
✅ **Route TTS translations** to meeting app microphone  
✅ **Use your real voice** AND translations simultaneously  
✅ **Hear TTS translations** yourself while they play  
✅ **Your peers hear** both your voice and translations  
✅ **Transcribe all participants** in the meeting  

**Complete Audio Flow:**
```
Your Voice → Real Mic ──────┐
                            ├→ Aggregate Device → Meeting App ──→ Peer hears you + TTS ✅
TTS Audio → Virtual Device ─┘           ↓
            ↓                    (System Audio Output)
   Multi-Output splits:                  ↓
   ├→ Virtual Device Input      Meeting Assistant captures ──→ Transcribes peer ✅
   └→ Your Speakers ──→ You hear TTS + peer ✅
```

## Meeting Application Configuration

**⚠️ CRITICAL FOR DESKTOP APPS (Teams, Zoom):**

To capture audio from desktop meeting applications, you **MUST** configure BOTH:

**Microphone:**
- **macOS**: "Aggregate Device" (your Mic + BlackHole device)
- **Windows (VB-Cable)**: "CABLE Output"
- **Windows (VoiceMeeter)**: "VoiceMeeter Output"

**Speaker (⚠️ IMPORTANT):**
- **macOS**: "Multi-Output Device" (BlackHole + Speakers)
- **Windows (VB-Cable)**: "CABLE Input"
- **Windows (VoiceMeeter)**: "VoiceMeeter Input"

**Why speaker matters:**
Desktop meeting apps use protected audio that bypasses system routing. Setting the speaker explicitly to your Multi-Output Device forces audio through BlackHole for capture while still playing through your speakers.

**Browser-based apps (teams.microsoft.com, zoom.us) don't need speaker configuration - they work automatically!**

### Telegram Desktop

1. Go to **Calls** tab → Click **⋮** (three dots)
2. Select **"Call Settings"**
3. **Microphone**: Select your aggregate/virtual device
4. **Speakers**: Keep as regular speakers

### Zoom

1. **Settings** (gear icon) → **Audio**
2. **Microphone**: Select your aggregate/virtual device
3. **Speaker**: Keep as regular speakers

### Microsoft Teams

**⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR TEAMS DESKTOP APP:**

To capture Teams audio, you MUST set the speaker output to your Multi-Output Device.

1. **Profile** → **Settings** → **Devices**
2. **Microphone**: Select **"Aggregate Device"** (your aggregate device)
3. **Speaker**: Select **"Multi-Output Device"** ⚠️ (NOT your regular speakers!)

**Why this is necessary:**
- Teams desktop app uses protected audio streams that bypass system audio routing
- Setting Teams speaker to Multi-Output Device forces audio through BlackHole
- You'll still hear calls because Multi-Output includes both BlackHole AND your speakers

**Visual Guide:**

![Teams Audio Settings](../static/teams-audio-settings.png)

**Configuration checklist:**
- ✅ Microphone: Aggregate Device
- ✅ Speaker: Multi-Output Device
- ✅ Automatically adjust mic sensitivity: On (recommended)

**Alternative for Teams Web:**
- If using browser version (teams.microsoft.com), keep speakers as regular output
- Browser audio is captured automatically through system audio routing

### Discord

1. **User Settings** (gear icon) → **Voice & Video**
2. **Input Device**: Select your aggregate/virtual device
3. **Output Device**: Keep as regular speakers

### Browser-Based Apps (Meet, Zoom web, etc.)

**In-meeting controls:**
- Click microphone icon → Select your aggregate/virtual device

**Browser settings:**
- Chrome/Edge: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Microphone
- Safari: Safari → Settings → Websites → Microphone
- Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Permissions → Microphone

**Test online**: https://www.onlinemictest.com/

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Start Meeting Assistant**: `uv run python gui_app.py`
2. **Enable translation**: Check ☑️ "Enable TTS to Microphone"
3. **Select language**: Choose target language
4. **Test voice**: Speak into mic → Peer should hear you ✅
5. **Test TTS**: Wait for translation → Click "Speak to Mic" → Peer hears translation ✅
6. **Verify you hear TTS**: Should play through your speakers ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### macOS

**Peer doesn't hear my voice:**
- ✅ Check real microphone is in Aggregate Device
- ✅ **Verify real microphone is FIRST (leftmost) in Subdevices order**
- ✅ Enable "Drift Correction" on real mic AND BlackHole
- ✅ Test Aggregate in System Settings → Sound → Input

**Peer doesn't hear TTS:**
- ✅ System output set to Multi-Output Device
- ✅ Meeting app mic set to Aggregate Device
- ✅ BlackHole included in both devices
- ✅ Real microphone is first in Aggregate Device order

**I don't hear TTS:**
- ✅ Set Multi-Output as system output
- ✅ Speakers included in Multi-Output
- ✅ Enable "Drift Correction" on BlackHole

### Windows

**No sound through speakers:**
- VB-Cable: Check "Listen to this device" enabled
- VoiceMeeter: Check A1 set to speakers and enabled

**Peer doesn't hear me:**
- VB-Cable: Meeting app should use CABLE Output
- VoiceMeeter: Check Hardware Input 1 set to your mic, B1 enabled

### General

**Virtual device not found:**
```bash
# Check devices
python -c "import pyaudio; p = pyaudio.PyAudio(); [print(f'{i}: {p.get_device_info_by_index(i)[\"name\"]}') for i in range(p.get_device_count())]; p.terminate()"
```

**Audio choppy:**
- ✅ Enable "Drift Correction" 
- ✅ Increase buffer size in code: `tts_audio_router.py` line 110 (1024 → 2048)

### ⚠️ Meeting Apps Not Captured (Teams, Zoom)

**Problem:** YouTube/browser audio works, but Teams/Zoom audio is NOT captured by the app.

**Root Cause:** Meeting applications use **protected audio streams** or **exclusive audio modes** that bypass the system audio mixer, preventing BlackHole/VB-Cable from capturing their output.

**Why It Happens:**
- Meeting apps prioritize audio quality and use direct hardware access
- They may use exclusive WASAPI mode (Windows) or CoreAudio HAL (macOS)
- Security/DRM features prevent system-level audio capture
- Browser audio (YouTube) works because it goes through the regular system mixer

**Solutions:**

#### ✅ Solution 1: Configure Meeting App to Use Multi-Output Device (RECOMMENDED & FREE)

**This is the BEST solution for desktop meeting apps!**

**For Teams:**
1. Teams → Settings → Devices
2. **Speaker**: Select **"Multi-Output Device"** (the one you created in Step 3)
3. **Microphone**: Select **"Aggregate Device"**
4. Test: You should hear calls AND Meeting Assistant should capture audio ✅

**For Zoom:**
1. Zoom → Settings → Audio
2. **Speaker**: Select **"Multi-Output Device"**
3. **Microphone**: Select **"Aggregate Device"**
4. Test call to verify

**Why this works:**
- You explicitly tell the meeting app to output to Multi-Output Device
- Multi-Output includes both BlackHole (for capture) AND your speakers (so you hear it)
- No additional software needed!
- Works with full desktop app features (screen sharing, etc.)

**See screenshot:** [Teams Audio Settings](../static/teams-audio-settings.png)

#### Solution 2: Use App-Specific Audio Routing (macOS - Professional)

Install commercial audio routing software that can capture individual app audio:

**Audio Hijack by Rogue Amoeba** ($64) - **RECOMMENDED FOR TEAMS** ⭐
- https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/
- Mix your real microphone with TTS audio and route to Teams
- More reliable than BlackHole for Teams integration
- 10-minute free trial (unlimited restarts for testing)
- **See detailed setup guide below** ↓

**Loopback by Rogue Amoeba** ($99) - Professional Solution
- https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/
- Create virtual audio source from specific apps
- Route Teams/Zoom → Virtual Device → Meeting Assistant
- Non-invasive, works with all meeting apps
- **Setup:**
  1. Install Loopback
  2. Create new virtual device
  3. Add Teams/Zoom as audio source
  4. Route to BlackHole or new virtual output
  5. Set Meeting Assistant to capture this device

**SoundSource** ($39) - Simpler option
- https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/
- Per-app audio routing
- Easier to use but less flexible

#### Solution 2: Use Meeting App Settings (Partial Solution)

Some meeting apps allow output device selection:

**Teams:**
1. Settings → Devices
2. **Speaker**: Set to "BlackHole 2ch" instead of regular speakers
3. **Limitation**: You won't hear the call through your regular speakers
4. **Workaround**: Use Multi-Output Device (BlackHole + Speakers)

**Zoom:**
1. Settings → Audio
2. **Speaker**: Set to "BlackHole 2ch"
3. Same limitations as Teams

**⚠️ Important:** This means the meeting app will output to BlackHole, but you may need to adjust your Multi-Output Device configuration.

#### Solution 3: Browser-Based Meetings (Workaround)

Use **browser versions** of meeting apps instead of desktop apps:
- ✅ Teams Web (teams.microsoft.com)
- ✅ Zoom Web (zoom.us/join)
- ✅ Google Meet (meet.google.com)

Browser audio goes through the system mixer and CAN be captured by BlackHole!

**Steps:**
1. Join meetings via browser instead of desktop app
2. Keep your existing BlackHole/Multi-Output setup
3. Browser audio will be captured automatically ✅

**Limitations:**
- Some features may be missing in web versions
- Browser performance may be lower
- Camera/screenshare might be limited

#### Solution 4: Screen Recording Audio (macOS)

Use macOS built-in screen recording with audio capture:

1. Open **QuickTime Player** → **File** → **New Screen Recording**
2. Click **Options** → Select **BlackHole 2ch** as microphone
3. Record during meeting
4. Use recorded audio file later with `transcribe_audio_file.py`

**Limitations:**
- Not real-time transcription
- Post-meeting processing only
- Creates large video files

#### Solution 5: Virtual Machine or Second Device

Run meeting app in VM or on second device:
- Route audio from VM/device to main computer
- Capture via BlackHole
- Complex setup, not recommended for most users

**Recommendation Priority:**

1. **🥇 Best:** Configure meeting app speaker to Multi-Output Device - **FREE & Full Features** ✅
2. **🥈 Good:** Browser-based meetings - Free but limited screen sharing
3. **🥉 Professional:** Loopback by Rogue Amoeba ($99) - Advanced features
4. **📝 Fallback:** Record and transcribe later - Not real-time

#### Verification Test

To verify if meeting app audio is being captured:

1. **Start Meeting Assistant**: `python gui_app.py`
2. **Join test meeting** or play test audio in meeting app
3. **Check transcription window**: Do you see the meeting audio transcribed?
   - ✅ **YES**: Audio is being captured
   - ❌ **NO**: Audio is protected, use one of the solutions above

**Test with YouTube first:**
- If YouTube works but Teams doesn't → Protected audio issue
- If YouTube also doesn't work → Configuration issue (check BlackHole setup)
